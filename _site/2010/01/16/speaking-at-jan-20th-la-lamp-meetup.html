I will be giving a short presentation on HauteLook's architecture at the <a title="LA LAMP website" href="http://www.meetup.com/lalamp/">LA LAMP meetup</a> on January 20th.  I have been meaning to join a user group for some time, so this worked out perfectly.  Any developers in the LA area on that day should come, even if it is just for the free food and beer.
