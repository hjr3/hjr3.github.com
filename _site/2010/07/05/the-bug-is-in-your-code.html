I stumbled across this while reading some tweets: <a href="http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=52198">http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=52198</a>.  This reminded me of something I was told while attending a programming workshop at college: over 90% of the time the bug is in your code.  At the time I didn't think about this much as I had been writing code for only about 6 months and assumed the third party libraries I was using were bug free.  As I continue to grow as a developer and engineer, I am amazed at the number of developers immediately blaming the library or framework they are using for a bug in their project.  Bugs do exist in all code, but it is more likely that the bug is in your code.
