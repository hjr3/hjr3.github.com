<p>
I am a sociologist turned full stack engineer turned VP of Engineering at <a href="https://www.nordstromrack.com/">Nordstromrack.com | HauteLook</a> in downtown Los Angeles. At one point, I designed and built most of the hypermedia API that drives the Nordstromrack.com | HauteLook website and mobile applications. I write PHP during the day at work and am a Rustacean at night. I spent a past life writing a lot of C and used that knowledge to help maintain the <a href="https://pecl.php.net/package/memcache">pecl/memcache</a> and <a href="https://pecl.php.net/package/gearman">pecl/gearman</a> extensions. I find myself with a renewed interest in systems programming, especially async IO.<br/>
<br/>
Outside of technology, I enjoy homebrewing, hiking, camping and reading.
</p>
<p>
I also organize the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Rust-Los-Angeles/">Rust Log Angeles Meetup</a>. Come join us if you are in the LA area and want to meet other people who are using Rust.
