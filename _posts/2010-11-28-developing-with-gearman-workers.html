The documentation for Gearman is really good.  You can have workers running within minutes following <a title="Basic Gearman Example" href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/gearman.examples-reverse.php" target="_blank">examples</a> from php.net.  However, there seems to be a lack of advanced examples for working with Gearman.  I have not seen a good discussion on how to integrate Gearman into an existing architecture.<!--more-->

The majority of Gearman worker examples look something like this:
<code>&lt;?php
$gmworker= new GearmanWorker();
$gmworker-&gt;addServer();
$gmworker-&gt;addFunction("reverse", "reverse");</code>

while($gmworker-&gt;work()) {
if ($gmworker-&gt;returnCode() != GEARMAN_SUCCESS) {
echo "return_code: " . $gmworker-&gt;returnCode() . "\n";
break;
}
}

function reverse($job)
{
return strrev($job-&gt;workload());
}

I like to think of Gearman workers as controllers in an MVC application.  I have a thin controller, fat model philosophy.  That means controllers are responsible for accepting a request, passing along parameters to the model and sending back a contextual response.  There are a number of advantages to approaching Gearman workers this way.  Testing becomes much easier now that the business logic is in the model.  Automated integration tests can be written for the gearman workers.  It also allows the business logic to be called in multiple ways.  The model can via a web request, a Gearman worker or even a command line script.

I don't think that a controller (and by extension a Gearman worker) should be responsible for bootstrapping itself.  That is exactly what the above example does.  There are a few problems with allowing the worker to bootstrap itself.  The biggest issue is that it does not scale well.  The above example may work in some production environments, but one should plan for the day where the Gearman server does not reside on localhost or that there may be multiple Gearman servers for fail-over purposes.  Another issue with allowing the worker to bootstrap itself is consistency.  If each individual on a development team implements the bootstrapping process a little differently than anyone else, it becomes harder to maintain.

Here is how I think the above Gearman worker should look:

Now we need a generic way to bootstrap a worker.  I want to focus on bootstrapping for development first and will discuss production later.  I think code needs to not only be testable, but easy to run.  Gearman workers are no exception.  Having automated integration tests are great, but a test will inevitably fail at some point and we will have to fix it.  We need a way to easily start-up a worker, see it handle a job and get the result.  To accomplish this, I wrote a shell script that wraps the Gearman worker in a generic bootstrapping process.  It works like this:

This allows for a consistent bootstrapping process that isn't even tied to the environment.  We could use this script to hook up to the Gearman daemon on the staging server
