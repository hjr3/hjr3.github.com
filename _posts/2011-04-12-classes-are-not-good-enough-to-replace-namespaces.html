PHP arrived on the namespace scene late.

The namespace support in PHP sucks.  There, I said it.  I am not talking about the choice of syntax either.  I could really care less if the namespace operator is a backslash or not.  What I am talking about is having true namespace support.  The current namespace support in PHP is for classes only.  This is great if you write your PHP code like Java, but if I wrote that way I would just write in Java to being with.  Sometimes I only functions and want to be relatively sure that

In the beginning PHP had functions.  One big problem was that all functions were global.  It was not an uncommon occurrence for two developers to use the same function name and encounter fatal errors as a result.  The solution for this was to prefix your functions with some sort unique identifier.  In essence, the functions were now namespaced and Timmy the developer could go to sleep at night relatively sure that his  choice of function names would not cause any fatal errors.  If you could get over the excessively long function names, you still had no guarantee that a particular group of functions were all in the same file.  Countless standards were made on how application functions should be organized in relation to the file system, but who follows standards right?  Long lists of include_once or require_once statements made their way into every file so you could guarantee that the function you needed would be there.

Classes provided a lot of solutions
