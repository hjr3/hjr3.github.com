## Rust Lifetimes

**Abstract:** _A complete walkthrough of lifetimes in Rust. This talk will take us from the basics of how lifetimes work, discuss why we may need to be explicit about them and end talking about advanced topics, such as higher-ranked lifetimes._

## Systems Programming for Web Developers

**Abstract:** _This a call to action for web developers to get involved in systems programming. The modern web stack is getting more complex, but too few people know how to create and support the essential elements of that stack. I believe this is because systems programming has historically had too many barriers to entry. Modern systems languages, like Rust, are breaking down these barriers. Ever wanted to write a toy shell or create your own version of memcache? Rust makes systems programming feel much more approachable to web developers._

## HAL - A Lean Hypermedia Type

**Abstract:** _The web is made up links and forms that allow people to intuitively grasp how to navigate and interact with pages. Hypermedia APIs take traditional REST APIs provide them these same affordances. Hal is a simple hypermedia format that is built on top of JSON. The Hal hypermedia type allows API authors to link representations together to create an API that is more easily consumable by the client. As more and more of the technology around is powered by APIs, it is critical that we learn how to build them in a way that allows us for versioning, backwards compatibility and flexibility._

## Grokking HTTP Methods

**Abstract:** _We have probably all heard of REST. It is currently the popular way to create APIs for internal and/or external use. Virtually all RESTful APIâ€™s are built on top of HTTP. Thus, it is important to understand how the different HTTP methods work. They are key to creating a solid RESTful API and offer so much more than simple CRUD. We will be taking a deep-dive into the HTTP methods and providing some foundation for further exploration of HTTP and how it relates to RESTful APIs._
